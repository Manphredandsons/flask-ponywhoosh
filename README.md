## contributing

We wrote this package inspired by other awesome packages available,  we are trying to go beyond for you and for us `:P`. 

These  were:
- `flask_whooshalchemy`
- `flask-whooshee`

So if you have new ideas or want to fix something, make a pull-requests. We're going to appreciate it for sure.

Some stuff  we need to complete for  this software, are:

- tests for searching over models 
- tests for searching over Whoosh objects
- tests for searching over all these types of search that Whoosh allow to us.
- improve the documentation, to make it  more clear and accurate.
