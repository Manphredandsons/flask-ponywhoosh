## contributing

We wrote this inspired by other awesome packages available, and we are trying to go more beyond for you and for us `:P`. 

These are:
- `flask_whooshalchemy`
- `flask-whooshee`

So if you have ideas or want to fix something, make a pull-requests. We're going to appreciate it for sure.

Somethings that we need to complete this software are:

- tests for searching over models 
- tests for searching over Whoosh objects
- tests for searching over all these types of search that Whoosh allow to us.
- improve the documentation, to make more clear and accurate.
